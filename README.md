# Security and Server Setup Automation

Welcome to the repository for your security and server setup automation scripts! This set of scripts is designed to streamline the installation and configuration of security tools (iptables and Snort) and a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on your server. Below, you'll find information on the structure of the repository and how to use the scripts.

## Repository Structure

- **implementation.sh**: This script contains functions to set up iptables rules and Snort rules. The main script executes these functions to configure the security policies on your server.

- **installation.sh**: This script includes functions for installing iptables, Snort, OpenSSH, and configuring a LAMP stack. It ensures a secure and functional server environment.

## How to Use

### 1. Installation of Components
To install iptables, Snort, OpenSSH, and configure a LAMP stack:

```bash
./installation.sh
```

This script will:

Install iptables for firewall management.
Install Snort for intrusion detection.
Install OpenSSH for secure remote access.
Install and configure a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

### 2. Security Policy Setup

To set up security policies using iptables and Snort:

```bash
./implementation.sh
```

This script will:
- Set up iptables rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Configure Snort rules for intrusion detection.

### Note

- Make sure to run the scripts with the appropriate permissions, such as using `sudo` to execute commands that require elevated privileges.

- The LAMP stack installation assumes the server's IP address is "172.31.23.49". If your server has a different IP, modify the script accordingly.

- For Apache, the script sets the ServerName directive in the Apache configuration. If you have a domain name, replace "172.31.23.49" with your domain.

- Before running the scripts, it's recommended to review and customize them based on your specific server and security requirements.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided as a starting point and may need adjustments based on your server environment and security needs. Use them responsibly, and always ensure that your server adheres to security best practices.

Happy server setup and security hardening! üõ°Ô∏èüöÄ
